            <h2 class="about-h2"> WHY JONAPWD WAS FORMED </h2>
            <p class="m_2">

                Generally, the attitude of the public towards Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) has not been very
                helpful to their development. Consequently, PWDs have found it very difficult to make the kind of
                positive contributions they would have loved to make to societal development. Public attitude towards
                PWDS are often negative, discriminatory, condescending, and full of misconceptions that stem from
                lack of proper understanding of persons with disabilities and issues that affect them. It is towards
                this end that the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD) Anambra state
                chapter came into being as a platform for:
                <br>
            <ol>
                <li> 	Generating coherent ideas on how to tackle the problems of PWDs</li>
                <li>PWDs to have a common voice, help them identify their own collective and individual needs and
                    be able to express views on their priorities.</li>
                <li>	Evaluation of services targeted for PWDs.</li>
                <li>Advocating for change, public awareness creation on PWDs and issues.</li>
                <li>Self-development of PWDs and harnessing of opportunities to develop skills and talents.</li>
                <li>Mutual support among PWDs.</li>
                <li>Mainstreaming PWDs into the larger society so as to encourage them to live independent lives.</li>
            </ol>
