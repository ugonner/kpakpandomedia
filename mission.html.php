            <h3>VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>

                The mission of Kpakpando Media, comprising Kpakpando Community Radio and
                Kpakpando Community Newspaper, can be summed up in a quest to pioneer a new
                perspective in Nigerian journalism by shifting focus from the conventional
                urban-based journalism to the rural communities.
            </p>

            <p>

                The focus of Kpakpando Media is therefore to continuously and consistently provide an objective
                and honest voice for all segments of the people of non-urban and semi-urban
                communities, including community leaders, business owners,politicians,
                educational,religious and cultural institutions as well as feed them with
                up-to-date information on how people and events reflect on their community values.
                In doing this, Kpakpando Media strives to bridge the communication and
                information gap that has for a very long time existed between the rural and
                urban communities in Nigeria on the one hand, and between rural communities
                and local, State and Federal governments, a bridge that has led to slow rate
                of development of rural communities â€“ socially, economically, educationally
                and politically.

            </p>
            <p>

                Our mission of bridging the rural-urban information gap also includes
                making the voice of our rural dwellers heard by government and non-governmental
                organizations charged with development-oriented services to the people by
                highlighting the problems of rural dwellers and helping to attract government
                attention and solution.

            </p>

            <p>

                At the same time, the Kpakpando Media acts as a development catalyst, mobilizer
                and educator to awaken the self-help creative potentials of rural dwellers
                towards the betterment of their own condition by seeking practical solutions
                for the problems affecting their communities through social, economic and
                political development initiatives to augment government interventions.

            </p>

            <p>

                We also showcase the creative potentials and achievements of our rural
                communities in diverse areas of endeavor including politics, business
                and self-help community development including giving a strong voice to the
                arts and culture of rural communities and spreading the word about all the
                great events taking place in our rural communities, both for the entertainment
                and edification of urban dwellers.

        <div class="col-sm-4">

                These are in addition to providing quality advertising and exposure to rural
                business owners at cheap and affordable rates so they can promote their
                product or service within and beyond the immediate vicinity.

            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, we aim to enhance the literacy level of rural dwellers
                through coverage of local events and business and  low newspaper cover price
                which makes it affordable to the majority of rural residents. In this way too,
                we promote and sustain the cultural and traditional norms of  rural communities.

            </p>

            <p>

                In this way, Kpakpando  Media is pioneering a shift from the traditional press
                approach to rural coverage which has largely been limited to reportage of crimes
                and other negative events, but hardly  reports  good or positive news about the
                rural communities such as achievements in community development, conflict
                resolution and peace process, education, business, agriculture, etc.

            </p>

            <p>

                Finally, the Kpakpando Media aims at being a real community newspaper
                and a platform that  really cares and nurtures the people it promotes and
                works with, namely, the rural communities.  Thus, over the the past one year
                of inception, Kpakpando Media , through its Micro-Finance subsidiary  has given
                over twenty million naira in women empowerment interest-free loans as well as in
                free donations and in-kind services to widows, destitutes and the less privileged
                rural dwellers as a way of enhancing and maintaining sustainable rural livelihoods.

            </p>


            In summary, the mission of Kpakpando Media encapsulates a mission to re-discover
            and project the problems and prospects of rural dwellers and help them find
            solutions as well as celebrate their achievements and assist them grow their
            creative potentials in all areas of livelihood, thus enhancing rural
            socio-economic status, reducing traditional rural poverty and reversing
            the current rise in rural-urban migration in the country.
